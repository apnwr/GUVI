*Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property

When we try to access an undefined variable it always returns undefined and we cannot get 
or set any property of undefined. In that case, an application will throw “Uncaught TypeError 
cannot set property of undefined.”

var test = undefined;
test.value = 0;

output:
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'value' of undefined

If the test object does not exist, error will throw “Uncaught TypeError cannot set property of 
undefined.”
