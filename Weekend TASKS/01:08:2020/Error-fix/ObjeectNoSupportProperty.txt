*TypeError: Object doesn't support property

This is an error that occurs in IE when you call an undefined method. 
You can test this in the IE Developer Console.

This is equivalent to the error "TypeError: ‘undefined’ is not a function" in Chrome. 
Yes, different browsers can have different error messages for the same logical error.

This is a common problem for IE in web applications that employ JavaScript namespacing. 
When this is the case, the problem 99.9% of the time is IE’s inability to bind methods within 
the current namespace to the this keyword. For example, if you have the JS namespace Rollbar 
with the method isAwesome. Normally, if you are within the Rollbar namespace you can invoke 
the isAwesome method with the following syntax:
this.isAwesome();

Chrome, Firefox and Opera will happily accept this syntax. IE, on the other hand, will not. 
Thus, the safest bet when using JS namespacing is to always prefix with the actual namespace.
Rollbar.isAwesome();
